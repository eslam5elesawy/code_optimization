# Code Optimization

Code optimization is the process of improving the efficiency, performance, and resource utilization of our programs. The main goal of code optimization is to make programs run faster, consume less memory, and use fewer system resources while still achieving the desired functionality.

## Main Points of Code Optimization

- Enhanced Speed and Performance
- Reduced Memory Usage
- Decreased Processing Time

## When to Optimize Code

- Initial Development
- When Performance Goals are Not Met
- Before Release
- Continuous Improvement

## How to Optimize Your Code

There are a number of different ways to optimize your code, and the approach you take will depend on the language you're using, the platform you're targeting, and the specific goals you're hoping to achieve. In general, though, there are a few basic principles you can follow to optimize your code:

### Optimization Techniques

- ### Use the right data types:
  Optimizing code performance relies on selecting appropriate data types to minimize conversions and enhance efficiency. Utilizing the smallest data type capable of accurately representing the data being worked with is advisable. For instance, using a `byte` data type instead of an `int` for numbers â‰¤ 255 conserves resources and improves code efficiency.
- ### Keep your code as simple as possible:
  One of the most important principles of optimizing code is to keep it as simple as possible. This means minimizing the amount of code required to achieve a desired outcome.
- ### Cache frequently used data: 
  By caching data, you can avoid having to recalculate it every time it is needed, which can save a significant amount of time.
- ### Avoid unnecessary I/O: 
  Make sure that your code only reads from and writes to files when it absolutely needs to.
- ### Use the most efficient algorithms: 
  Algorithms with lower time complexity will generally run faster and consume less resources.

  - Linear Search (Before Optimization)
In a linear search, you look through each element in the list one by one until you find the target.

  **Example Code:**

 **Time Complexity:** O(n)

  - Binary Search (After Optimization)
In a binary search, you take advantage of the sorted nature of the list and repeatedly divide the search interval in half.

**Example Code:**

![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/binary_alg.png)

   
 **Time Complexity:** O(log n)

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/linear_ex.png)


In these diagrams, the arrow points to the current element being compared to the target. In linear search, you scan each element until you find the match, which can be slow for large lists. In binary search, you quickly narrow down the potential locations of the target by dividing the remaining search space in half with each step. This is much faster for large lists.

## Loop Optimization
Enhancing the performance of loops through techniques like loop unrolling, loop fusion, or loop tiling.
Here's an example of a simple linear search without optimization:

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/loop_op.png)

Here's the same search, but optimized with a break statement:

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/loop_break.png)


By adding the break statement, the loop stops as soon as the number is found, potentially saving time and computation, especially if the number is located early in the array.

## Resource Optimization
Resource optimization on mobile platforms is crucial due to the limited hardware resources such as CPU, memory, and battery life. Let's consider an example of resource optimization in a mobile application that displays images downloaded from the internet, such as a social media app.

**Example:**
### Image Loading and Caching (Before Optimization)
Suppose the app directly downloads full-resolution images as users scroll through their feed. This approach can be very resource-intensive for several reasons:
- **Network Usage:** Downloading full-resolution images uses a lot of data, which can be slow and costly for the user.
- **Memory Usage:** High-resolution images consume a lot of memory when loaded into RAM.
- **CPU Usage:** Decoding large images can be CPU-intensive, causing the app to lag.
- **Battery Life:** High network, memory, and CPU usage drain the battery more quickly.

### Image Loading and Caching (After Optimization)
To optimize this, you could employ several strategies:
- **Downsampling:** Download lower-resolution versions of images when a high resolution is unnecessary (e.g., when displaying thumbnail previews).
- **Lazy Loading:** Only load images when they are about to appear on the screen rather than preloading images that the user may never scroll to.
- **Image Caching:** Cache downloaded images to disk or in memory. This way, if the user scrolls back or revisits an image, the app doesn't need to re-download it, saving network and CPU resources.
- **Asynchronous Loading:** Load images asynchronously in the background to ensure a smooth and responsive user interface.

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/Resource_op.png)

In this optimized scenario, the CachedNetworkImage widget from the Flutter package cached_network_image handles caching and asynchronous loading of images.

By implementing these optimizations, the app will use fewer resources, which leads to:
- **Reduced Data Usage:** Saves money for users with metered data plans and can improve performance on slow networks.
- **Lower Memory Footprint:** Reduces the risk of out-of-memory errors and allows the app to run smoothly on devices with limited RAM.
- **Decreased CPU Load:** Results in a more responsive app and less heat generation from the device.
- **Extended Battery Life:** Efficient resource usage means the battery will last longer.
These improvements enhance the overall user experience by making the app faster and more responsive, while also being considerate of the device's limitations and user's data plans.

# Dead Code Elimination
Copy propagation often leads to making assignment statements into dead code.
A variable is said to be dead if it is never used after its last definition.
In order to find the dead variables, a data flow analysis should be done.

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/dead_code.png)

In this example, there are several instances of dead code:

- The variable `unusedValue` is computed but never used anywhere else in the function `calculateValue`.
- The `else` block in the `calculateValue` function is redundant because if the input is less than 0, the function will return 0 and never reach the `else`.
- The `return -1;` statement is never reached because the function will return before it gets to that point.
- The entire `neverCalledFunction` is dead code because it is defined but never invoked in the program.
- The call to `neverCalledFunction()` in the main function is also dead code because the main function does not call it, as it's commented out.

Dead code elimination would remove these parts of the code, resulting in a more efficient, maintainable, and potentially smaller program:

 ![Code example](https://github.com/eslam5elesawy/code_optimization/blob/afcbe4a7f14c0226caa6f498c2ccc272f0c8be2f/dead_code_opd.png)

By eliminating the dead code, the program becomes clearer and easier to understand. Additionally, it may compile to a smaller binary, and there could be slight performance improvements since there's less code to load or execute.
